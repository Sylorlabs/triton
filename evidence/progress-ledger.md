| E.capability-default | pass | `src/capability.zag`; `agent-capability-denial` | default read/inspect/simulate; unauthorized placement leaves project hash unchanged | Add scoped/expiring grants |

| F.layout-persistence | pass | `ui-preferences` | left/right/bottom splits round-trip separately from project data | Add invalid preference fuzz cases |
| I.render-discovery | pass | `gpu_open`; `--gpu-info` | Scans DRM render minors and accepts only a successful AMDGPU info query; found minor 128 | Query full firmware/IP/memory tuple |
| I.display-gpu-certification | blocked | `lspci`, `/dev/dri`; masterplan 12.1 | Only RX 5700 XT is also the display GPU; destructive reset/fault certification requires a non-display GPU | Complete all bounded non-destructive work; do not fake certification |

Unchecked items in `masterplan.md` remain `not-run` unless this ledger or a
linked dated report gives a more specific state.
