Linux `7.0.11-76070011-generic`; x86-64; X11 `:0`; PowerColor Radeon RX 5700 XT
is the only GPU and drives the display.

| Item | State | Change / evidence | Last result | Next |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A.inventory | pass | `rg --files`; source/probe/tool inventory recorded during baseline | 69 Zag/Python modules plus scripts/docs identified | Keep updated in evidence index |
| A.compiler | pass | `../zag/zag-poc/znc`, sibling Git commit `807c03d`, SHA above | Supported self-hosted compiler identified | Re-record at release |
| A.single-test-entry | pass | `verify.sh`, `tools/verify.zag` | Pure-Zag orchestrator emits JSON result records | Run safe gate |
| A.baseline-engine | pass | `./verify.sh safe`; `probe/engine_test.zag` | 61 assertions passed after replacing a stale user-specific temp path | Expand persistence fault coverage |
| A.gpu-default-safety | pass | `build.sh`, `tools/verify.zag` | GPU memory and dispatch probes are explicit modes; default does not touch DRM | Keep GPU opt-in |
| B.versioned-model | pass | `src/device_model.zag`; `probe/engine_test.zag` | Schema v1 carries units, source, method, date, uncertainty, confidence, and known state | Expand per-component bindings |
| B.derived-timing | pass | `changing device model changes derived timing without source edit` | Runtime model-rate change altered compiled symbol clock | Add dimensional property coverage |
| B.incomplete-model | pass | `incomplete model cannot silently advance verified simulation` | Missing group index sets `model_ok=false` and blocks stepping | Expose complete diagnostics in agent/UI |
| B.model-roundtrip | pass | `roundtrip: device model version pinned`; `physical model values preserved` | Project format v2 preserved schema and physical inputs | Add corruption/migration fixtures |
| B.claim-cleanup | pass | `README.md`; `tools/verify.zag` unsupported-claim audit | README separates illustrative, simulated, measured, and unknown evidence | Extend audit allowlist and generated evidence |
| E.native-automation | pass | native `--agent`, `--mcp`, `zagctl`; legacy Python client removed | Supported automation path is compiled Zag | Add capability enforcement |
| F.x11-live-baseline | pass | `./verify.sh safe`; `--x11-selftest` on `DISPLAY=:0` | Motion, modifier, key, button, WM_DELETE, and PutImage round trip passed | Add resize/focus/reopen coverage |
| F.x11-interleaving | pass | `X11.synth_seen`; live selftest | Synthetic proof no longer flakes when real pointer events interleave | Add resize/focus synthetic cases |
| I.render-discovery | pass | `gpu_open`; `--gpu-info` | Scans DRM render minors and accepts only a successful AMDGPU info query; found minor 128 | Query full firmware/IP/memory tuple |
| I.display-gpu-certification | blocked | `lspci`, `/dev/dri`; masterplan 12.1 | Only RX 5700 XT is also the display GPU; destructive reset/fault certification requires a non-display GPU | Complete all bounded non-destructive work; do not fake certification |

Unchecked items in `masterplan.md` remain `not-run` unless this ledger or a
linked dated report gives a more specific state.
